## About the Week 1 lab
A short, professional triage exercise where I:
- Deployed a test Ubuntu VM (Vagrant/VirtualBox) and generated SSH brute-force failures.
- Captured network traffic with `tcpdump`/Wireshark and extracted relevant packets.
- Collected host artifacts with a triage script and ingested `/var/log/auth.log` into Splunk.
- Produced a triage report (see `week-01-soc-triage/triage_report.md`).

> **Note:** All artifacts in this repository are sanitized or synthetic. No real customer data or private credentials are included.
